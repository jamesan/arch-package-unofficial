# Arch Linux package specs

These PKGBUILDs and associated files are for packages in which I'm not the official maintainer,
usually forked from the official package spec, and usually:

- to update an outdated package without an updated version; or
- to fix bugs in the package spec or bring it closer to packaging guidelines; or
- to expand a package with unofficial features.
